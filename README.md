# Csharp6502
A emulator for the MOS Technologies 6502 processor implemented in C#

I mean to strike a balance between easy to read code and actual efficency of the emulation itself. The emulator is well on its way to fully functional, I'm running Klaus2m5's functional tests to iron out those final bugs. My end goal is to write a C64 or NES emulator in C# .NET, but that's a long way down the road at this point.

Currently the biggest TODOs are getting the BRK instruction working properly and getting the processor to be cycle accurate (also adding BCD mode and getting the V flag working properly for all instructions).

I'm not entirely done yet, but it's getting quite far through the functional tests. Consider this to be a mostly??? functional work in progress!
