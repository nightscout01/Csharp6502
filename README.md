# Csharp6502
A emulator for the MOS Technologies 6502 processor implemented in C#

I mean to strike a balance between easy to read code and actual efficency of the emulation itself. The emulator is well on its way to fully functional, I'm running Klaus2m5's functional tests to iron out those final bugs. My end goal is to write a C64 or NES emulator in C# .NET, but that's a long way down the road at this point.
